title: Xcode Archive for Mac
summary: Create an archive for your macOS project
description: |
  The Step creates an archive using the `xcodebuild archive` command for your macOS project so you can share it, upload it, or deploy it.

  ### Configuring the Step

  Before you start:
  
  Make sure certificates are uploaded to Bitrise's **Code Signing** tab.

  To configure the Step:
  
  Under **app/pkg export configs**:

  1. Select the method Xcode should sign your project in the **Export method** input.
  1. (Optional) Specify a custom export option in the **Custom export options plist content** input. If you leave this input blank or the Step doesn't find an export method based on the provisioning profile(s), the Step will use the development method.

  Under **xcodebuild configs**:

  1. Add the path where your Xcode Project or Workspace is located in the **Project (or Workspace) path** input.
  1. Add the scheme name you want to use to archive your project in the **Scheme name** input.
  1. (Optional) By default, your Scheme defines which configuration is used, but you can override this option in the **Configuration name** input. 
  1. In the **Clean build before archive** input, select `yes`, if you want to run a `clean xcodebuild` before the `archive` action. Select `no` to skip this.
  1. (Optional) If you wish to make your build times faster, and you don't need indexing, consider turning it off by setting **Disable indexing during the build** input to `yes`.

  Under **force archive codesign settings**:

  1. (Optional) If you want to force `xcodebuild` to use specified code sign identities or provisioning profiles, you can do so in the inputs under the **force archive codesign settings** tab.

  Under **step output configs**:

  1. Select an `xcodebuild` command log format in the **Output tool** input. Available options are `xcpretty`: The xcodebuild command's output will be prettified by xcpretty. `xcodebuild`: Only the last 20 lines of raw xcodebuild output will be visible in the build log. The raw xcodebuild log is exported in both cases.
  1. Specify which directory will contain the generated `.app` or `.pkg` files and the `.dSYM.zip` files in the **Output directory** input. 
  1. Provide a name to use as a basename for the generated files in the **Generated Artifact Name** input.
  1. If you want to export the archive, set the **Export the generated archive?** input to `yes`. This will compress the generated files into a zip file and move them to a folder `output_dir`.
  1. If you want to export the dsyms, set the **Export all dsyms?** input to `yes`.
  1. Set **Enable verbose logging** input to `yes` to produce more informative logs.

  ### Troubleshooting

  If you receive an error about missing signing certificates during this Step, make sure that your certificates are uploaded to Bitrise's **Code Signing** tab.

      - `developer-id`: Save a copy of the application signed with your Developer ID.

      Specifies a custom export options plist content that configures archive exporting.
      If empty, Step generates these options based on provisioning profile,
      with default values.

      Auto generated export options available for export methods:

      - app-store
      - ad-hoc
      - enterprise
      - development

      If the Step doesn't find an export method based on the provisioning profile(s), the development method will be used.

      Call `xcodebuild -help` for available export options.

      **Make sure that the Configuration you specify actually exists
      in your Xcode Project**. If it does not (for example, if you have a typo
      in the value of this input), Xcode will simply use the Configuration
      specified by the Scheme and will silently ignore this parameter!

    description: |-
      Could make the build faster by adding `COMPILER_INDEX_STORE_ENABLE=NO` flag to the `xcodebuild` command which will disable the indexing during the build.

      Indexing is needed for

      * Autocomplete
      * Ability to quickly jump to definition
      * Get class and method help by alt clicking.

      Which are not needed in CI environment.

      **Note:** In Xcode you can turn off the `Index-WhileBuilding` feature  by disabling the `Enable Index-WhileBuilding Functionality` in the `Build Settings`.<br/>
      In CI environment you can disable it by adding `COMPILER_INDEX_STORE_ENABLE=NO` flag to the `xcodebuild` command.

- force_team_id:
  opts:
    title: Force Developer Portal team to use during archive
    description: |-

- force_code_sign_identity:
  opts:
    title: Force code signing with Identity

      Force xcodebuild to use specified Code Sign Identity.

      Specify code signing identity as full ID (e.g. `Mac Developer: Bitrise Bot (VV2J4SV8V4)`)
      or specify code signing group ( `Mac Developer` or `Mac Distribution` ).

      You also have to **specify the Identity in the format it's stored in Xcode project settings**,
      and **not how it's presented in the Xcode.app GUI**!
      **The input is case sensitive**: `Mac Distribution` works but `mac distribution` does not!

- force_provisioning_profile_specifier:
  opts:
    title: Force code signing with Provisioning Profile Specifier
    description: |-
      Used for Xcode version 8 and above.

      Force xcodebuild to use specified Provisioning Profile.

      How to get your Provisioning Profile Specifier:

      - In Xcode make sure you disabled `Automatically manage signing` on your project's `General` tab
      - Now you can select your Provisioning Profile Specifier's name as `Provisioning Profile` input value on your project's `General` tab
      - `force_provisioning_profile_specifier` input value build up by the Team ID and the Provisioning Profile Specifier name, separated with slash character ('/'): `TEAM_ID/PROFILE_SPECIFIER_NAME`

      Format example:

      - `1MZX23ABCD4/My Provisioning Profile`
    category: force archive codesign settings
- force_provisioning_profile:
  opts:
    title: Force code signing with Provisioning Profile
    description: |-
      Force xcodebuild to use the specified Provisioning Profile.

      Use Provisioning Profile's UUID. The profile's name is not accepted by xcodebuild.

      How to get your UUID:

      - In Xcode select your project -> Build Settings -> Code Signing
      - Select the desired Provisioning Profile, then scroll down in profile list and click on Other...
      - The popup will show your profile's UUID.

      Format example:

      - c5be4123-1234-4f9d-9843-0d9be985a068
